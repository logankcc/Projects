# FractionCalculator

The goal of this assignment was to develop a fraction class in C++ and practice the use of overloaded operators. An object of the Fraction class holds a fraction in a normalized state with different data members for the numerator and denominator. The Fraction class contains many overloaded operators for easy object arithmetic.
